\opening{To whom it may concern,} 
 
\noindent I am a junior at Western Washington University studying computer science. I have heard about intership possitions at Blizzard Entertainment and was very exited to apply. 
I am an avid gamer when I have the time. Some of my achievements include diamond level StarCraft II 1v1 and Silver League of Legends. Though I do not have the time to game as much currently, 
my passion has merely been passed by my passion for coding and development.
 
\noindent In the past year, I have developed a great interest and passion for coding. My areas of interest are still unbound by any one specific area. I have explored several areas, 
such as web development and mobile development. Blizzard offers an opportunity to explore different area of development in a structured eviornment. 
Blizzard offers a variety of different possitions in areas I have enjoyed working in, such as web development. I have found enthusiasm through working on personal projects would like to 
move to a larger scale. Blizzard offeres this chance and more and for me to grow and expand on my skill sets.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
