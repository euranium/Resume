\opening{To whom it may concern,} 
 
\noindent I am a junior at Western Washington University studying computer science. I have heard about intership possitions at Girls Who Code and was very exited to apply. 
I am a member of the Association for Women in Computer Science and Association for Computing Machinery. Through those programs and on my own, I have grown to enjoy teaching 
others and helping out others. 
 
\noindent Over the past year, I have developed a great interest and passion for coding. My areas of interest are still unbound by any one specific area. I have explored several areas, 
such as web development and mobile development. Girls Who Code offers an opportunity to develope my skills in coding and teaching in a structured eviornment. 
Girls Who Code offers a possitions in the area of teaching and web development, both of which I have enjoyed. 

\noindent With expanding on my skills, I also hope to help people who have not had my possitive experience find their own way in computer science.
I have found enthusiasm through working on personal projects and with others and would like to 
move to a larger scale. Girls Who Code offeres this chance and more and for me to grow and expand on my skill sets and promote a science I love.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
