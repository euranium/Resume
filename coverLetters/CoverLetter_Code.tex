\opening{To whom it may concern,}

\noindent I am happy to apply for your Software Developer Internship because application development and internet technology is my field of choice.
I became interested in Twilio after looking into your API. I found the documentation very clear and helpful. Software

\noindent I am a junior at Western Washington University studying computer science. As a member of the Association for Women in Computer Science and Association for Computing Machinery,
I stay active in the community. Through those programs, past internships and my own pet projects I keep up to date on modern technology and stay sharp with my coding skills.


\noindent With expanding on my skills, I also hope to help people who have not had my possitive experience find their own way in computer science.
I have found enthusiasm through working on personal projects and with others and would like to
move to a larger scale. Girls Who Code offeres this chance and more and for me to grow and expand on my skill sets and promote a science I love.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}


\end{letter}
